### üìä Visualizations & Insights  

| **Industries have the highest AI adoption rates** | **Countries have the highest AI adoption rates** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/1.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/2.png" width="400"> |
| AI adoption is consistently high across the board ‚Äî no country or industry in the charts drops below ~48%. | Certain sectors (Gaming, Finance) and regions (UK, France) are pushing the upper limits, showing they could be early leaders in AI-driven economic advantage. |

| **Impact of AI adoption rate on Revenue** | **Job Loss due to AI by Industry** |

| <img src="charts/3.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/4.png" width="400"> |
| Industries like Automotive, Media, and Manufacturing show the highest revenue gains from AI adoption.| Manufacturing experiences the highest job losses, indicating significant automation impact. |

| **Job Loss due to AI by Country** | **Sectors showing the highest collaboration rates between humans and AI** |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="charts/5.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/6.png" width="400"> |
| Across countries, Canada and Germany report the highest job loss percentages, while the USA and Australiya shows relatively low job losses | Education leads with the highest Human-AI collaboration rate (58.9%), Media shows the lowest (50.0%) |

| **Relationship between human-AI collaboration rate and Consumer trus** | **Relationship between job loss due to AI and revenue increase** |

| <img src="charts/7.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/8.png" width="400"> |
| Industries with higher collaboration rates don‚Äôt always have the highest consumer trust. | Industries seeing higher job loss due to AI tend to show a small but positive correlation with increased revenue, suggesting some economic benefits despite workforce cuts. |

| **Relationship between job loss due to AI and Consumer Trust** | **Global Trend in Market Shares of AI Companies** |

| <img src="charts/9.png" width="400"> | <img src="charts/10.png" width="400"> |
| Consumer trust in AI also shows a slight upward trend with job losses, meaning job reductions haven‚Äôt strongly eroded public trust overall. | Sharp Decline in 2025 ‚Äì The drop to ~25.7% in 2025 signals potential saturation, increased competition, or reduced adoption. |

| **Trend in top Tech Countries** |   |

| From 2020‚Äì2025, the UK surged to lead the global AI market, overtaking a declining USA, while China grew with volatility and India showed steady, consistent gains. |  


## üìù Conclusion
From this analysis, we can conclude:

1. **High Global AI Adoption:** No country or industry drops below \~48% adoption, showing strong worldwide integration.
2. **Emerging Leaders:** Sectors like Gaming and Finance, and regions like the UK and France, are pushing the upper limits of adoption.
3. **Narrowing Gap:** The spread between the highest and lowest adoption rates is small, indicating global convergence in AI usage.
4. **Revenue vs Job Loss:** Automotive, Media, and Manufacturing see high revenue gains from AI, but Manufacturing also faces the highest job losses.
5. **Country-Specific Impacts:** Canada and Germany report the highest job loss percentages, while the USA maintains low job losses despite AI growth.
6. **Collaboration vs Trust Dynamics:** Education has the highest AI-human collaboration rate but low trust, while Retail shows high trust with moderate collaboration.
7. **Balanced Industries:** Marketing and Healthcare maintain a healthy balance between collaboration (\~55%) and trust (\~58‚Äì60%).
8. **Weak Link Between Job Loss & Trust/Revenue:** Job losses show only a slight positive correlation with revenue and trust, with high variability across contexts.
9. **Global Market Trends:** AI companies‚Äô global market share grew from \~24.5% in 2020 to \~29.6% in 2024 before dropping sharply to \~25.7% in 2025.
